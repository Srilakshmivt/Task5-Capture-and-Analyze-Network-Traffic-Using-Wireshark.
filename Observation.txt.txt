Title: Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark 

Objective:-
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

Tools Used:-
Wireshark (version 4.4.8)

Procedure:-

1. Opened Wireshark and selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi).

2. Started packet capture and generated traffic by browsing, searching on Google, and watching a short YouTube video.

3. Stopped the capture after 3 minutes and saved it as a network capture. Pcap.

4. Used the “Protocol” column and “Statistics ? Protocol Hierarchy” to identify traffic types.

Findings:-

Total Packets Captured :-   90075

Main Protocols Identified: HTTP, DNS, TCP/UDP.

HTTP (10%) – Web traffic in plaintext.

HTTPS (60%) – Encrypted web traffic.

DNS (5%) – Domain lookups.

TCP (20%) – Transport connections.

ARP (3%) – Local address resolution.


Traffic Types:-

Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)

DNS resolution

TCP/UDP

Background system services

Conclusion:-
The capture showed a mix of encrypted and unencrypted traffic, with HTTPS dominating due to secure browsing. DNS queries and ARP requests were frequent, indicating normal network activity.
An ARP request packet is a message used in local networks to find the MAC address of a device when its IP address is known.
DNS query, also known as a DNS request, is a message sent from a user's computer (the DNS client) to a DNS server to find the IP address associated with a domain name
